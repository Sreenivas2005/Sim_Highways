Have designed a Clapp Oscillator using BJT Amplifier with an operating frequency of about 120 kHz.
The design notes for Oscillators have also been used.

Issues Faced :
-> cannot view the initial parts of the waveform because the settling time required for the oscillation
-> while using an Rc instead of an RF choke, there was a negative offset voltage of around 3V, I couldn't understand the reason for that
-> Also need to learn how I can increase the output voltage swing.
